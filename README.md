OpenStack threat modeling
==========================

This directory contains analysis reports for OpenStack threat modeling.
Initially, we use mark down(.md) format for writing reports due to the enhanced
readability compared to the docbook format. In future, we move towards docbook
format for the purpose of integrating threat modeling reports with the
OpenStack security guide. This folder is a stagging area for threat analysis
reports.

A quick overview of files and underlying directory structures are provided here

Keystone Threat Modeling : Token Provider
=========================================

###System Overview
Application version
:   Keystone Havana Stable Release
   
Application Description
:   Keystone has a customizable token provider. Token provider can be either UUID or PKI token. PKI as a default one by system configuration. UUID token is 128 bit, provides a random opaque, generated by uuid4().PKI tokens are cryptographic Message syntax (CMS) string, generated by Openssl. PKI tokens require signing key and cert. The cert needs to be distributed to the token verifier. Both PKI and UUID token are bearer tokens

Additional Info
:  

###Implementation Overview
Major Components
:   Keystone.token.providers.pki/uuid
    UUID driver
    PKI driver
    
Dependent components
:  UUID generator
Crypto: CMS (Openssl)
Other Kesytone  components: Token API 
Key: Signing key, Certflie

Description
: Major process:
  Issue token:  Issue_v2_token, Issue_v3_token
  Validate token: Validate_v2_token, Validate_v3_token
  Revoke token: revoke_token 


###System Assumptions (External Dependencies)
 -  Data coming from Token API service is trustworthy
   
###Security Objective
 - Generate cryptographically secure random id as token_id
 - Ensure Integrity protected token data (PKI token)

###Entry Points
Token Controller
: Token generation incoming requester

Configuration parameters
: expiration, signing key asset is coming from CONF

CMS (openssl)
:  subprocess to perform PKI token signing. Signed token is returned from CMS.

Cache
:  token for validation can be retrieved from cache

Persistance layer (DB):
:  Token creation phase data is stored in DB, validation phase data 
   is retrived from DB

###Threats
####TokenProvider-01
Threat: 
> Spoofing: Spoofing of UUID4 Token

Threat Agent:
>  Internet attacker

Attack Vectors:
> Using weakness in UUID4 token generation (randomness), an attacker can guess a valid UUID token ID.

Security Weakness:
>  UUID4 uses os.urandom to generate 128 bit randomness and encode 122 bit of it to generate a UUID4 token. Assuming os.urandom provides random bits, the attacker has
the 2^(-122) probability to guess a UUID4 token id. 

Counter Measures:
> M2.crypt or other crypt libraries to get full 128 bit of randomness. 

Extra:
> Probability: Near Zero
  impact: High

  Comments: This is not a feasible threat towards the component. This is reported as an informative note.


####TokenProvider-02
Threats:
> Tampering : Expiration time tampering

Threat Agent:
> Internal attacker/ wrong value assignment

Attack Vectors:
> Token expiry is determined by the configuration 'expiration' parameter. An internal attacker (with the permission to change conf file) can modify the 'expiration' parameter to generate long lived valid token, increasing the exposure possibility. Or, reduce the expiration
time to a low value, causing frequent new token generation. This can lead to performance degradation and possibly DoS.  

Security Weakness:
> 

Counter Measures:
> Keystone.conf file permission limited.
Any changes to 'expiration' value should be judged against Security vs Performance. 
  

Extra:
> Probability: Low
  impact: Low

####TokenProvider-03
Threats:
> Spoofing: Spoofing of PKI Token

Threat Agent:
> Internal Attacker

Attack Vectors:
> PKI token is created using openssl which requires signing key. The signing key
is referred in the keystone.conf file. Two scenarios can happen here 1) a system user with the ability to modify the keystone.conf file can point to a tampered signing key. 2) A system user with ability to read signing keyfile can can generate PKI tokens 

Security Weakness:
> 

Counter Measures:
> keystone.conf file access control limited.
  Signing key file access limited.

Extra:
>  Probability:Low
   Impact:High

####TokenProvider-04
Threats: 
> Denial of Service attack for PKI token

Threat Agent:
> Internet attacker

Attack Vectors:
> Depending on the setup, PKI tokens may need to sign large amount of data (with V3, including catalog) during token generation process. A large number of token signing request can lead to performance degradation of PKI signing engine. 

Security Weakness:
> Large amount of data to sign during token generation 

Counter Measures:
> Reduce token size: compress, striping of catalog

Extra:
>  Probability: Low
   Impact: Medium

####TokenProvider-05
Threats:
> Repudiation: Accountability of Token provider

Threat Agent:
> Internal

Attack Vectors:
> An internal attacker can place a token directly in the DB/persistence layer without knowing which token providers has created the token. 

Security Weakness:
> The token provider does not generate any log event. 

Counter Measures:
> Token provider should generate a log event for each generated token.

Extra:
>  Probability: High
   Impact: Low
